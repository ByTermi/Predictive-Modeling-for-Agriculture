However, it can be an expensive and time-consuming process, which can cause farmers to prioritize which metrics to measure based on their budget constraints.\n\nFarmers have various options when it comes to deciding which crop to plant each season. Their primary objective is to maximize the yield of their crops, taking into account different factors. One crucial factor that affects crop growth is the condition of the soil in the field, which can be assessed by measuring basic elements such as nitrogen and potassium levels. Each crop has an ideal soil condition that ensures optimal growth and maximum yield.\n\nA farmer reached out to you as a machine learning expert for assistance in selecting the best crop for his field. They've provided you with a dataset called `soil_measures.csv`, which contains:\n\n- `\"N\"`: Nitrogen content ratio in the soil\n- `\"P\"`: Phosphorous content ratio in the soil\n- `\"K\"`: Potassium content ratio in the soil\n- `\"pH\"` value of the soil\n- `\"crop\"`: categorical values that contain various crops (target variable).\n\nEach row in this dataset represents various measures of the soil in a particular field. Based on these measurements, the crop specified in the `\"crop\"` column is the optimal choice for that field.  \n\nIn this project, you will build multi-class classification models to predict the type of `\"crop\"` and identify the single most importance feature for predictive performance.","metadata":{},"id":"d3d001b0-2e2f-4b58-8442-99520bad831f","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# All required libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn import metrics\n#from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer\n\n# Load the dataset\ncrops = pd.read_csv(\"soil_measures.csv\")\n\n# Check for missing values in each feature column\ncrops.isna().sum()","metadata":{"id":"bA5ajAmk7XH6","executionTime":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":null,"executionCancelledAt":null,"lastExecutedAt":null,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastExecutedByKernel":null,"outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":249,"type":"dataFrame","tableState":{"customFilter":{"const":{"type":"boolean","valid":true,"value":true},"id":"dd25fe33-60fb-4149-a344-76c106df10d0","nodeType":"const"}},"chartState":{"chartModel":{"modelType":"range","chartId":"id-thn3d71l3pb","chartType":"groupedColumn","chartThemeName":"datalabTheme","chartOptions":{"common":{"animation":{"enabled":true}}},"chartPalette":{"fills":["#6568A0","#43D7A4","#4095DB","#FACC5F","#CAE279","#F08083","#5BCDF2","#F099DC","#965858","#7DB64F","#A98954"],"strokes":["#6568A0","#43D7A4","#4095DB","#FACC5F","#CAE279","#F08083","#5BCDF2","#F099DC","#965858","#7DB64F","#A98954"],"up":{"fill":"#459d55","stroke":"#1e652e"},"down":{"fill":"#ef5452","stroke":"#a82529"},"neutral":{"fill":"#b5b5b5","stroke":"#575757"},"altUp":{"fill":"#5090dc","stroke":"#2b5c95"},"altDown":{"fill":"#ffa03a","stroke":"#cc6f10"},"altNeutral":{"fill":"#b5b5b5","stroke":"#575757"}},"cellRange":{"rowStartIndex":null,"rowStartPinned":null,"rowEndIndex":null,"rowEndPinned":null,"columns":[]},"switchCategorySeries":false,"suppressChartRanges":false,"unlinkChart":false,"version":"32.2.2"},"rangeChartModel":{"rangeColumns":[],"switchCategorySeries":false}}}},"visualizeDataframe":false,"version":"ag-charts-v1"},"id":"d0eb4f16-5a99-460d-a5ba-706b7ef0bbe7","cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v2+json":{"table":{"schema":{"fields":[{"name":"index","type":"string"},{"name":"0","type":"integer"}],"primaryKey":["index"],"pandas_version":"1.4.0"},"data":{"0":[0,0,0,0,0],"index":["N","P","K","ph","crop"]}},"total_rows":5,"truncation_type":null},"text/plain":"N       0\nP       0\nK       0\nph      0\ncrop    0\ndtype: int64"},"metadata":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v2+json":{"status":"success"}},"execution_count":1}]},{"source":"# Separate features and target variable\nX = crops.drop(\"crop\", axis=1)\ny = crops[\"crop\"]","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":67,"lastExecutedAt":1769819402016,"lastExecutedByKernel":"5ce2f05c-0205-499a-88ff-63d4676c5005","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Separate features and target variable\nX = crops.drop(\"crop\", axis=1)\ny = crops[\"crop\"]","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":222,"type":"dataFrame","tableState":{"customFilter":{"const":{"type":"boolean","valid":true,"value":true},"id":"dbd44178-4750-41e8-bd94-ddfa22a28159","nodeType":"const"}}}}},"cell_type":"code","id":"1e001ee8-6cbb-4c60-b589-a515d8c544c9","outputs":[],"execution_count":2},{"source":"# Split the dataset into training and testing sets\n# X: features, y: target variable\n# test_size=0.2 means 20% of the data will be used for testing, 80% for training\n# random_state=12 ensures reproducibility of the split\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=12, test_size=0.2)","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":58,"lastExecutedAt":1769819402075,"lastExecutedByKernel":"5ce2f05c-0205-499a-88ff-63d4676c5005","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Split the dataset into training and testing sets\n# X: features, y: target variable\n# test_size=0.2 means 20% of the data will be used for testing, 80% for training\n# random_state=12 ensures reproducibility of the split\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=12, test_size=0.2)"},"cell_type":"code","id":"d27c7953-136a-47d4-be5a-34f7f7f93371","outputs":[],"execution_count":3},{"source":"features_dict = {}\nfeature_performance = {}\nlog_reg = LogisticRegression(multi_class=\"multinomial\")\n\n# Loop through each feature in the dataset\nfor feature in X.columns.tolist():\n    print(\"Training with \", feature)\n    \n    #

Key Findings\nAfter evaluating each soil nutrient individually using **Logistic Regression**, the results showed that:\n* **Potassium (K)** is the best individual predictor for crop type, achieving an **F1-score of 0.257**.\n* **Phosphorous (P)** followed with a score of **0.100**.\n* **Nitrogen (N)** and **pH** showed the lowest predictive power when used in isolation.\n\n### 2. Technical Interpretation\nThe relatively low F1-scores across all individual features indicate that soil chemistry is complex. A single nutrient is not enough to accurately determine the ideal crop. This highlights the importance of **multivariate analysis** in agricultural data science.\n\n### 3. Future Work & Improvements\nTo improve the model's accuracy, the following steps are proposed:\n* **Multivariate Modeling:** Train a model using all features ($N, P, K, ph$) simultaneously.\n* **Algorithm Benchmarking:** Compare Logistic Regression against non-linear models like **Random Forest** or **XGBoost**.\n* **Data Scaling:** Apply `StandardScaler` to normalize the feature ranges.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4a66cce2-89af-4b12-bd90-6f2c128f45e5"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
